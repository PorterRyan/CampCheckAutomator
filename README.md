# CampCheckAutomator
A camp check spreadsheet automator for Portola Redwoods State Park.

I created this program as a side project during downtime while working for Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks at Portola Redwoods State Park. It has a specific use-case, but I decided to
publish the code in case it might be useful for someone else (and in case future service aides have a desire to modify or enhance the code after I move on).
